# Ridiculous-Streaming
 Godot 4. x implementation of Twitch IRC chat and API inside the engine with a lot of BS going on.

### Known features
- User can inject BBcode in the Dock chat

### TODO features
- Announcements are not hooked up yet. They should be.
- When Raid happen, nothing happens. I think it isn't nice.
