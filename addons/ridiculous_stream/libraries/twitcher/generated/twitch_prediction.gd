var winning_outcome_id: String;
## The list of possible outcomes for the prediction.
var outcomes: Array[TwitchPredictionOutcome];
## The length of time (in seconds) that the prediction will run for.
var prediction_window: int;
## The prediction’s status. Valid values are:      * ACTIVE — The Prediction is running and viewers can make predictions. * CANCELED — The broadcaster canceled the Prediction and refunded the Channel Points to the participants. * LOCKED — The broadcaster locked the Prediction, which means viewers can no longer make predictions. * RESOLVED — The winning outcome was determined and the Channel Points were distributed to the viewers who predicted the correct outcome.
